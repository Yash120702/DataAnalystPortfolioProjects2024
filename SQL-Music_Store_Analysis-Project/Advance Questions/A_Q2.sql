/* Question Set 3 - Advance */

/* Q2: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre 
with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where 
the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres. */

/* Steps to Solve:  There are two parts in question- first most popular music genre and second need data at country level. */

/* Method 1: Using CTE */
