In this project, we followed a systematic approach to analyse the data of the bike store.
1. Created the database in MS-SQL server.
2. Created 2 schemas, i.e., productions and sales.
3. Created tables for both the schemas.
4. Inserted data into the tables through SQL queries.
5. Then wrote a main query to fetch only the desired columns and fields across the database in a particular order.
6. Imported the data from the MS-SQL server to an MS-Excel sheet.
7. Performed data cleaning in Excel.
8. Performed data visualization.
9. Used slicers to make the dashboard interactive.
